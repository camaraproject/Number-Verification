# Number Verify API documentation

## Overview

### Introduction

CAMARA Number Verify API aims to deliver proof of device possession, that is attached to SIM card and MSISDN, using mobile network authentication.

CAMARA community agreed to enable Number Verify API in two complementary flavours:

1. Based on CAMARA standardization guidelines, that enables API service on a dedicated endpoint and follows CAMARA AuthN/AuthZ concept. [More details available here](#details)
2. Based on GSMA Mobile Connect standardized family of Identity APIs, that delivers Verified MSISDN service. [More details available here](#details)
