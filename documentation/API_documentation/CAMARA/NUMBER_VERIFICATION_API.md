# Overview

Number Verification API is used to verify that the provided **mobile phone number** is the one used in the device. It verifies that the user is using a device with the same *mobile phone number* as it is declared.
It also makes it possible for a Service provider to verify the number itself by returning the phone number associated to the authenticated user's access token.

## 1\. Introduction

Number Verification API performs real-time checks to verify the phone number of the mobile device being used to access a service provider (SP) service, where the mobile device is accessing the *service provider* over a mobile network (WiFi connections are out of this API scope) either by getting the comparison result or receiving the phone number of the device that it is used, so they can verify it themselves.

It uses direct mobile network connections to verify possession of a phone number in the background without requiring user interaction. There are neither OTPs (One-time passwords) received by SMS nor authenticator app downloads, so it is much simpler. It can be used at sign up, login, or transaction time to validate that a user's SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) is both actively connected to the mobile network and not spoofed or cloned.

**Out of scope:**

Not working on mobile hotspot (tethering) neither Wifi nor VPN mobile connections

## 2\. Quick Start

The usage of the API is based on several resources.

Before starting to use the API, the developer needs to know about the below specified details:

**API service endpoint**

Two endpoints are defined in Number Verification API:

- POST /number-verification/v0/verify : Verifies if the specified phone number (plain text or hashed format) matches the one that the user is currently using.
- GET /number-verification/v0/device-phone-number : Returns the phone number associated with the access token so API clients can verify the number themselves.

**Authentication**

Security access keys such as OAuth 2.0 3-legged Access Tokens used by Client applications to invoke this API with dedicated scope. Client **must use network based authentication methods** to use this service. 

Sample API invocations are presented in Section 4.6.

## 3\. Authentication and Authorization

Number Verification API uses OAUTH 2.0 auth_code grant which allows three-legged Access Tokens. [[1]](#1)

### 4.3 Errors

Since CAMARA Number Verification API is based on REST design principles and blueprints, well defined HTTP status codes and families specified by community are followed [[2]](#2).

Details of HTTP based error/exception codes for Number Verification API are described in Section 4.2 of each API REST based method.
Following table provides an overview of common error names, codes, and messages applicable to Number Verification API.

| No | Error Name | Error Code | Error Message |
| --- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- |
|1	|400 |	INVALID_ARGUMENT |	"Client specified an invalid argument, request body or query param" |
|2	|401 |	UNAUTHENTICATED |	"Request not authenticated due to missing, invalid, or expired credentials" |
|3	|403 |	PERMISSION_DENIED |	"Client does not have sufficient permissions to perform this action" |
|4	|403 |	NUMBER_VERIFICATION.USER_NOT_AUTHENTICATED_BY_MOBILE_NETWORK |	"Client must authenticate via the mobile network to use this service" |
|5	|403 |	NUMBER_VERIFICATION.INVALID_TOKEN_CONTEXT |	"Phone number cannot be deducted from access token context" |
|6	|500 |	INTERNAL | "Server error" |
|7	|503 |	UNAVAILABLE | "Service unavailable" |
